# Warmane Daily Points Collector  
<mark>Note:</mark> Does not work with the recent Warmane website  

---

## Automates the collection of daily points from [Warmane](https://www.warmane.com/)

When the script is run for the first time, it asks the user for the usernames and passwords for the accounts to collect their points, and saves these info in **clear text** in a file to load them from it when run again later. It will then go to [Warmane](https://www.warmane.com/) and login all accounts one at a time, collect its daily points and log out.
