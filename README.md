#Warmane Daily Points Collector

Automates collecting daily points from Warmane.

When you first run the program, it will ask for the number of accounts

that you want to use, then takes all usernames and passwords, saves

them into a configuration file for later.

Then it will log in all accounts one at a time, collect 

the daily points and and log out.
